## 🚀 Projects

### 🔹 AXI-Stream Based DSP Accelerator with Pipelined Low-Power 8×8 Multiplier & Floating-Point FFT (SPST)

- Developed a DSP accelerator using **AXI-Stream protocol** fully in Verilog for FPGA/ASIC.  
- Designed a **low-power 8×8 multiplier** implementing the **Spurious Power Suppression Technique (SPST)** to significantly reduce dynamic power.  
- Pipelined the design for near one sample per clock cycle throughput and minimized latency.  
- Verified protocol compliance, functionality via simulation testbenches and waveform analysis.  
- Included synthesis, timing, and power analysis scripts compatible with Cadence Genus.  
- Achieved timing-safe operation validated by positive slack margins > 7 ns.  
- Power analysis confirms notable dynamic power savings.

### 🔹 Low-Power 16×16 Multiplier with SPST Optimization

- Scalable multiplier with SPST for enhanced power efficiency.  
- Trade-off analysis of power, area, and speed.  
- Demonstrated improvements over baseline implementations.

### 🔹 Li-Fi Based Text Transmission System

- Secure wireless data transmission using visible light (Li-Fi).  
- Designed LED and photodiode-based transmitter/receiver circuits.  
- Incorporated error detection and noise resilience methods.

### 🔹 Image Denoising System in MATLAB

- Implemented multiple spatial filters for grayscale images.  

### 🔹 ElectroStorm Autonomous Mobile Robot

- Built during KSIT Hackathon 2025 with obstacle avoidance and path following.  
- Real-time navigation with sensor integration and embedded control.
